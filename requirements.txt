# ===============================
# GenPath-PPH Core Requirements
# ===============================
# Core Python libraries required to run the Persistent Path Homology (PPH)
# computations, perform statistical analysis, and generate visualizations.
# Compatible with Python >=3.10

# --- Topological and Mathematical Analysis ---
persim==0.2.1              # Persistence landscapes and distance computations
scipy==1.14.1              # KS test, permutation testing, and numerical operations
statsmodels==0.13.5        # Multiple testing correction (Benjamini–Hochberg)

# --- Data Processing and Bioinformatics ---
biopython==1.76            # Handling biological sequences and pathway data
GSEApy==1.1.3              # Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (for benchmarking)

# --- Visualization and Plotting ---
matplotlib==3.4.3          # General plotting utilities
mpl_toolkits==3.1.1        # 3D plotting (used with Matplotlib)
seaborn==0.11.2            # Statistical data visualization

# ===============================
# Optional R Dependencies
# ===============================
# Required only for external comparison methods (e.g., DEG analysis).
# Install within R environment, not via pip:
# annotationDbi==1.66.0
# org.Hs.eg.db==3.19.1
# edgeR==3.42.4
# DESeq2 (for DEG analysis)

# ===============================
# Notes
# ===============================
# - Tested with Python 3.12.6
# - Before running GenPath-PPH, ensure Gudhi is installed for persistence diagrams:
#   pip install gudhi
# - To reproduce benchmark comparisons (e.g., GSEA), ensure R and its packages are configured.
